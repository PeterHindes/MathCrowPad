Issues with rev1:
The led library I made has the wrong pins
The two top rotary encoders are not electricaly connected to ground, the ground plane is dissconnected
The rotary encoder non electrical holes are not plated for soldering
Probably want to use a plate mount for v2
screw hole on the bottom right, the screw head causes friction with the stabilizer bar
stabilizer stickers cover the vanity logos

Other Notes:
reset button on the kb2040 is hard to press when bottom mounted, top mount is possible with rev1 but not tested
possibly add side mounted reset button to board like levinson
unfixable without plate, switches lift up from unsoldered side
Matrix is not aligned with the key positions in the keymap. Perhaps the enter key should be moved up in th ematrix and the add key

Hardware Parts Selection:
The rotary encoders appear to trigger a rotation when they are clicked -- This may be a design error, investigating
