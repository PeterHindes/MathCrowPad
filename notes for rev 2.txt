Issues with rev1:
The led library I made has the wrong pins -- Fixed rev2
The two top rotary encoders are not electricaly connected to ground, the ground plane is dissconnected -- removed ground plane, used new router, fixed
The rotary encoder non electrical holes are not plated for soldering -- fixed
Probably want to use a plate mount for v2
screw hole on the bottom right, the screw head causes friction with the stabilizer bar -- fixed
stabilizer stickers cover the vanity logos -- logos removed
The miso pin may be a better driver for the rgb backlight look into qmk drivers

Other Notes:
reset button on the kb2040 is hard to press when bottom mounted, top mount is possible with rev1 but not tested
possibly add side mounted reset button to board like levinson
unfixable without plate, switches lift up from unsoldered side
Matrix is not aligned with the key positions in the keymap. Perhaps the enter key should be moved up in th ematrix and the add key
The South paw logo is too small
Logos on back will be covered


Hardware Parts Selection:
The rotary encoders appear to trigger a rotation when they are clicked -- This may be a design error, investigating
Will need to order more kb2040s

Current Design Notes TODO
no clearance for stema connector on top mounted desing, route cable between keys with underside cutout -- done
Consider pin socketed mounting -- done
consider hot swap keys
design needs to use switch plate which will require diffrent stabilizers

The CAD model for the oled does not line up with the screw holes
